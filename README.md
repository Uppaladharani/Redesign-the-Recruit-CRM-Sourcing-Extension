Design Explanation for the Recruit CRM Sourcing Extension Redesign

The redesign of the Recruit CRM Sourcing Extension focuses on improving efficiency, usability, and visual appeal. Below are the key design choices and their rationale:

Sourcing Workflow
1.	Bulk Import: Added a CSV file input to allow uploading multiple candidates at once, streamlining the process and saving time.
2.	Progress Bar: Shows the import status in real-time, ensuring recruiters are informed of the process and completion.
3.	Auto-fill Feature: Integrates with LinkedIn to auto-fill candidate details, reducing manual data entry and errors.

Visual Design
1.	Icons and Animation: Icons next to input fields (e.g., LinkedIn logo) enhance clarity, and subtle animations improve interaction flow.
2.	Theming: Allows users to toggle between light and dark modes, offering a personalized experience.

Feedback Mechanisms
1.	Toast Notifications: Replaces static messages with dynamic notifications for success and failure, keeping the interface clean.
2.	Error Highlighting: Displays error messages and highlights invalid fields, making it easier for users to correct mistakes.
3.	Detailed Logs: Provides downloadable logs for bulk imports, showing success/failure details and offering transparency.
